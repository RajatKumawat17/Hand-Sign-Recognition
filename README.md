![Hand Sign Recognition](https://github.com/RajatKumawat17/Hand-Sign-Recognition/blob/main/utils/images/output%201.jpg)

## Overview

This project utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow to perform real-time hand sign recognition. The system detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, processes the data with OpenCV, and classifies the hand sign using a TensorFlow model.

## Features

- Real-time hand sign recognition.
- Utilizes the power of MediaPipe for hand landmark detection.
- TensorFlow model for accurate hand sign classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RajatKumawat17/Hand-Sign-Recognition.git
   cd Hand-Sign-Recognition

2. Install the dependencies:
  
    ```bash
    pip install mediapipe
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install opencv 
    
3. How to run:

   ```bash
   python app.py

  - Open your webcam and make hand signs in front of it.
  - The system will recognize and display the hand sign in real-time.
